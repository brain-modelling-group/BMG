An online workshop at [CNS2020](https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2020).


# About
Human neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG)
reveals large-scale patterns of activity reflecting the brain’s functional complexity. However, the bulk of work seeking to analyse 
their dynamics and structure has traditionally focused either on temporal aspects, or on spatial aspects, but rarely the two combined. 
There is growing awareness in the neuroimaging community that computational neuroscience offers unifying approaches to understand large-scale brain dynamics. 
Conversely, neuroimaging data is a rich source of inspiration for the modeling community. 

This workshop aims to showcase recent advances at the intersection of computational neuroscience and human neuroimaging, with a focus on 
large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics. Two themes we will cover are: 1. Recent work modeling the neurobiology underpinning neuroimaging data; and 
2. Applications and data, highlighting challenges where computational neuroscience has much to offer.

Dr Kartik Iyer is a postdoctoral researcher at QIMR Berghofer with a biomedical engineering and computational neuroscience background, 
and nearly a decade of experience in the fields of child development, neurotrauma, and brain mapping. 
He combines highly multidisciplinary skillsets including biomedical signal/image analysis, machine learning, clinical neuroscience, 
and brain mapping methods (EEG & MRI) to examine developmental and physiological processes occurring in the brain and body. 
He has developed several prognostic biomarkers in a range of health and disease settings across the lifespan.

summary: Overview Neural Flows Toolbox 
abstract: Neural activity organizes in constantly evolving spatiotemporal patterns of activity, also known as brain waves (Roberts et al., 2019). Indeed, wave-like patterns have been observed across multiple neuroimaging modalities and across multiple spatiotemporal scales (Muller et al., 2016; Contreras et al. 1997; Destexhe et al. 1999). However, due to experimental constraints most attention has thus far been given to localised wave dynamics in the range of micrometers to a few centimeters, rather than at the global or large-scale that would encompass the whole brain. Existing toolboxes (Muller et al., 2016; Townsend et al., 2018) are geared particularly for 2D spatial domains (e.g., LFPs or VSDs on structured rectangular grids). No tool exists to study spatiotemporal waves naturally unfolding in 3D+t as recorded with different non-invasive neuroimaging techniques (e.g, EEG, MEG, and fMRI). In this work, we present results of using our toolbox neural flows.

In neonates, we use techniques from physics and machine learning to extract more information than ever before from intensive care monitoring of babies born prematurely. 
The goal is to enable early detection of injuries and early prognosis of developmental outcomes, so that clinicians can optimise care with personalised markers of brain health, potentially opening the window for new treatments.
